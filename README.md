Electric Vehicle Data Analysis 🚗💨

Welcome to the Electric Vehicle Data Analysis project! This repository contains all the code and resources related to my data analysis journey into the exciting world of electric vehicles (EVs). The project was completed as part of the Innomatics Research Labs Hackathon, where I explored a comprehensive dataset on electric vehicles and gained valuable insights.

🔍 Dataset:
The dataset provided for this project includes a wide range of information about electric vehicles, such as vehicle identification numbers (VINs), locations, make, model year, electric vehicle type, clean alternative fuel vehicle eligibility, electric range, base MSRP, and more.

🔧 Data Cleaning & Exploration:
Before diving into analysis, I conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure the dataset was in its optimal state. I handled missing values, corrected data formats, and removed any anomalies. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) allowed me to grasp the distribution and relationships of various variables, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.

📊 Interactive Plots with Plotly:
To visualize the data effectively, I employed Plotly, a powerful interactive data visualization library. Through Plotly, I created dynamic and interactive plots that showcased the patterns and trends within the dataset. These visualizations enhanced my understanding and made the data exploration process more engaging.

📍 Choropleth Plot & Racing Bar Plot:
The project features two standout visualizations: the Choropleth plot and the Racing Bar plot. The Choropleth plot displayed the geographic distribution of electric vehicles by location, while the Racing Bar plot animated the count of EV makes over the years. These visualizations brought life to the data and offered captivating insights.

🧠 Knowledge and Insights:
Throughout the project, I gained practical knowledge in data analysis and visualization techniques. I honed my skills in extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets, fostering a deeper appreciation for the EV industry's potential and significance.

💡 A Learning Journey:
This project was a fantastic opportunity for personal growth and learning. Exploring the realm of electric vehicles and analyzing their data allowed me to broaden my horizons in the field of data science and gain valuable hands-on experience.

🤩 An Exciting Experience:
The Innomatics Research Labs Hackathon provided an exciting and engaging experience. I am immensely grateful for the chance to take part in this knowledge-driven challenge and to be a part of a community that values continuous learning and innovation.
